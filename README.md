## Season of Epics: The clash between races - Open source game
The idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to create an online turn-based game and war reporting in the browser.

### Starting Tools:
* Back-end:
  - We use Java to build the server logic, data manipulation and interaction with the database.
  - Springboot 3.2+
  - jdbc client

* Motor : We use Java to create a Battle Report Engine: This engine will be especially highlighted for its ability to process battle events using the queuing process, ensuring a fluid and efficient workflow.

* Message Broker:
  - Rabbit:3-management to send battle between server and motor.
  
* Database:
   mysql:8.3

* Front-end:
